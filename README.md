### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to make buttons vertically stack and occupy the full width of their container. I achieved this by setting the flex-direction of the container to column and the width of the buttons to 100%.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on mastering responsive design techniques and refining my skills in CSS layout.
